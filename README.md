This document document describes a framework for a small project architecture framework called SPA. This framework is intended to be used if you want to build a small project but don't want to miss some crucial detail in the beginning.

The main reason why I created this framework is my desire to maintain a high quality even for the small projects with less efforts, keeping small projects fun. To archieve this SPA posesses the following feature:

- Minimalistic
- Giudance where it is needed
- Formal, but not overwhealming
- Easy to write and read

This framework is inspired by the following frameworks and models:

- c4model
- arc42
- 4+1 Architectural View Model
