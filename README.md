# Small Project Architecture (SPA)

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0--alpha-blue)

This document document describes a framework for a small project architecture framework called SPA. This framework is intended to be used if you want to build a small project but don't want to miss some crucial detail in the beginning.

The main reason why I created this framework is my desire to maintain a high quality even for the small projects with less efforts, keeping small projects fun. To achieve this SPA posesses the following feature:

- **Parallel development** of the project and the architecture.
- **Guidance** where it is needed
- **Low entry barrier**, can be implemented with any expertise in the topic, requires only basic knowledge of Markdown.
- **Structured** but not suffocating
- **Friendly** for new project contributors

This framework is inspired by the following frameworks and models:

- [c4 model](https://c4model.com/)
- [arc42](https://arc42.org/)
- [4+1 Architectural View Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model)

## How to use the framework

1. Copy the [template](doc/template.md) to your project documentation folder.
2. Start answering the questions in the template, and advance in your development during filling the template.
