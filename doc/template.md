# Architecture

## SPA Introduction

This document is written using [Small Project Architecture (SPA)](https://github.com/an-dr/spa) framework. A framework that keeps the quality high and the project fun.

Friendly Reminder:

> A good architecture makes the system easy to change, in all the ways that it must change, by leaving options open.
> *Robert C. Martin, Clean Architecture*
